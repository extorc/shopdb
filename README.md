## Project Overview
The E-Commerce Management System is a database-driven application designed for the Manager/Adminâ€™s POV to enable smooth management of an online shopping platform.
The system enables users to browse products, place orders, manage inventory, and handle customer transactions efficiently.
The project implements various database operations, including CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

## Methodology
The sidebar provides navigation between different sections such as Users, Products, Orders, and Statistics.
Each section loads data dynamically from the MySQL database and presents it using QTableWidget.
Users can add new records via pop-up dialogs using QDialog and submit the data to the database.
The Statistics section allows filtering order data and computing key metrics such as revenue, best-selling products, and highest-spending customers.
The UI elements are styled using built-in PyQt5 methods to ensure consistency and readability.

## Technologies Used
- **Database**: MySQL 
- **Backend**: SQL 
- **Frontend**: Python, PyQt5 for the GUI
- **Interface**: mysql.connector()
