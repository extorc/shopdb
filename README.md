# E-Commerce Database System

## Project Overview
This project is aimed at designing and implementing a robust database system for an e-commerce platform. The system efficiently manages product listings, customer details, orders, payments, and inventory.

## Features
- **User Management**: Stores and manages user details.
- **Product Catalogue**: Maintains product information including name, category, price, stock, and description.
- **Order Processing**: Tracks customer orders, payment status, and fulfillment.
- **Inventory Management**: Updates stock levels based on sales and new stock entries.
- **Payment Integration**: Records transaction details and ensures secure payment processing.
- **Data Analysis & Reporting**: Generates sales reports, revenue trends, and customer behavior insights using SQL queries.

## Technologies Used
- **Database**: MySQL / PostgreSQL
- **Backend**: SQL (PL/SQL for stored procedures)
- **Frontend (Optional)**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for UI-based interactions)
- **Interface (Optional)**: Flask / Node.js (to connect frontend and database)

## Database Schema
The database includes the following tables:
- **Users** (UserID, Name, Email, Address, Role)
- **Products** (ProductID, Name, Category, Price, Stock, Description)
- **Orders** (OrderID, UserID, TotalAmount, OrderStatus, Timestamp)
- **OrderDetails** (OrderDetailID, OrderID, ProductID, Quantity, Price)
- **Payments** (PaymentID, OrderID, Amount, PaymentMethod, Status, Timestamp)
- **Inventory** (InventoryID, ProductID, Stock, LastUpdated)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce-db.git
   cd ecommerce-db
   ```
2. Set up the database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE ecommerce_db;
   ```
3. Import the schema:
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p ecommerce_db < schema.sql
   ```
4. (Optional) Set up a backend connection if integrating with a web app.

## Usage
- Run SQL queries for inserting, updating, and retrieving data.
- Execute SQL scripts to generate sales reports and analyze trends.
- (Optional) Access the frontend interface to interact with the database visually.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement an API to connect the database with a web application.
- Add AI-driven analytics for customer behavior prediction.
- Implement advanced security measures for payment transactions.
